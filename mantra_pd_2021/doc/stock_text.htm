Mantra (1970) was originally scored for two pianos, each pianist
also controlling a ring modulator. The original ring modulators apparently had
very large frequency selection dials on which the pianists were called on to
select frequencies varying from about 10 Hz. to 4 Khz., but also sometimes
matching pitches of the piano so that accuracies better than 1 Hz. are needed.
Even if the pianists were actually able to select frequencies accurately in
this way (which seems doubtful) we have made what we think is a much better
implementation in which MIDI sliders, still controlled by the pianists, are
given appropriate ranges depending on where they are in the piece. Of course,
ring modulation itself offers no great challenge to a computer other than
controlling latency, which is particularly critical in this piece, and which we
have held to less than 10 milliseconds.  We have performed this piece twice so
far in public.  The electronics were realized by Kerry
Hagan with help from the author and Shahrokh Yadegari.

<P> Mantra also calls for crotales and a shortwave radio which one performer
tunes to any frequency where Morse code can be heard. Such frequencies being
rare today, we use a CD recording instead.

<P> The patch does ring modulation on two pianos, whose signals come in on
channels one and two of the computer.  There are two corresponding outputs.

There are
MIDI inputs from two slider boxes which allow the pianists to control "their"
respective modulators.

<P> Strictly speaking the patch implements single sideband modulation instead
of ring modulation.  Each partial of the piano sound is shifted up and/or down
in frequency by a chosen modulation frequency.

<P> The controls are "ring1-pitch," "ring1-plus", and "ring1-minus," plus the
corresponding controls for "ring2".  "Ring1" refers to the first modulator
which acts on input 1 and "ring2," correspondingly for input 2.  The 
"ring1-pitch" control specifies the modulation frequency in units of MIDI
pitch (i.e., "69" gives 440 Hz), with microtones allowed as in "69.5" and so
on.  The "ring1-plus" and "ring1-minus" controls specify the amplitudes
(the gains, really) of the positive and negative sidebands.  They are both
in decibels, with "100" corresponding to unity gain. In the analog counterpart, the positive
and negative sidebands are omnipresent. But in this patch, one can separate them out.
For the most accurate reproduction of <i>Mantra</i>, both the positive and negative sidebands (or "-plus" and "-minus")
should be set to the same value.

<P> In the qlist, these parameters can be given as single numbers as in the
first event:
<PRE>
     ring1-pitch 43;
     ring1-minus 100;
</PRE>
or as pairs of numbers like:
<PRE>
     ring1-pitch 74 2000;
</PRE>
If a single number is given, the "pitch" updates instantly and the two gains
change smoothly over a period of 30 milliseconds (about 1/33 second).  If you
give a second number this is a time in milliseconds to override this; for
instance, the example above makes a 2000-millisecond glissando to pitch 74
(from whatever the pitch was before) and similarly for the amplitudes which
can be faded in or out either more quickly or more slowly than the default.
